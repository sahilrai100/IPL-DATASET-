# IPL-DATASET-

This project performs IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset analysis and provides automated insights through FastAPI endpoints.
It combines web automation using Playwright and data processing with Pandas to extract, clean, and analyze match data such as top-scoring teams, win margins, and frequent venues.

The API can fetch data, perform analytical queries, and return structured JSON responses â€” making it suitable for both interview preparation and real-world data analysis tasks.
